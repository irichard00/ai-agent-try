# genie_tool/__init__.py Code Documentation

## File Summary

This is the package initialization file for the `genie_tool` package. Currently, it only contains standard package metadata (author, date) and is essentially empty of functional code. The file serves as a marker to make the directory a Python package and would typically contain package-level imports and initialization code.

## Contents

### File Header
- **Author**: liumin.423
- **Date**: 2025/7/7
- **Encoding**: UTF-8

### Functional Code
The file is currently empty of functional code, containing only:
- Standard Python encoding declaration
- Comment block with metadata
- Empty body

## Purpose

This `__init__.py` file serves the following purposes:

1. **Package Declaration**: Makes the `genie_tool` directory a Python package that can be imported
2. **Import Control**: Could potentially control what gets imported when `import genie_tool` is used
3. **Package Initialization**: Could contain package-level setup code if needed

## Typical Usage Patterns

In a more developed state, this file might contain:
- Package-level imports to expose key classes/functions
- Version information
- Package-level configuration or initialization code
- Submodule imports for easier access

## Example of what this could contain:
```python
from .api import api_router
from .tool.code_interpreter import code_interpreter_agent
from .tool.report import report
from .tool.deepsearch import DeepSearch

__version__ = "1.0.0"
__author__ = "liumin.423"
```

## Current Status

As it stands, this file is a minimal package initialization file that doesn't expose any specific functionality but enables the directory structure to work as a proper Python package.
